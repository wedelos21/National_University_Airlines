/**
 * This class documents all test classes for the National University Airlines application.
 * Since JUnit 5 doesn't natively support test suites without additional dependencies,
 * this class serves as documentation for all available tests.
 * 
 * To run all tests at once, use your IDE's test runner or Maven/Gradle test commands.
 * 
 * Available test classes:
 * - PassengerTest: Tests for the Passenger class
 * - SeatTest: Tests for the Seat class
 * - FlightTest: Tests for the Flight class
 * - ValidationUtilsTest: Tests for the ValidationUtils class
 * - FileStorageTest: Tests for the FileStorage class
 * - DatabaseServiceTest: Tests for the DatabaseService class
 * - FlightPersistenceTest: Tests for flight persistence functionality
