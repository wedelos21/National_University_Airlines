# 📘 National University Airlines Scheduler
*A Java Swing application for managing flight seat reservations.*

---

## ✈️ Project Overview
**National University Airlines** is a lightweight desktop tool written in Java that allows airline schedulers to view flights, manage seat availability, and record passenger information — all stored locally in a flat file (`database.txt`).  
Unlike commercial scheduling systems, this app is **free**, **offline**, and does **not** rely on cloud databases.
